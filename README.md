## Our Original Version

As a refresher, here's the original opening in our first AngularJS Readme:

*Before mainstream JavaScript usage, everything on the client was determined by the server. Routing and views were defined in backend code, meaning view logic was frequently mixed in with business logic, providing the end-user with a poor user experience.*

*This had its disadvantages, as data displayed on the page could only be updated when the user refreshes. This also meant no smooth transitions between pages.*

## Our Revised Version

Here's how we reworked it: 

*Ever wondered how Facebook can have a different timeline for millions of users? How Twitter can display tweets for 300 million people? How Gmail can let you send and receive emails, chat with your friends and view your contacts without having to even refresh the page? That's where frontend frameworks come in.* 

*Frontend frameworks have grown massively in the last 3 years. They help developers structure their applications and create interactive, super quick applications.* 

### Why Does This Work Better? 

Notice now how we don’t even touch anything super technical here. Instead we start with questions that immediately engage the reader because we’re talking about things- e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Gmail- that we can safely assume they’re familiar with. By introducing a familiar idea or problem, then we can talk about the solution, and at that point we can ease into the technical details. 

And what about that original opening section? We moved that to a new section after extensively introducing front-end frameworks. And we also reworked that too: 

*Before mainstream JavaScript usage, the server would do everything for us. When we'd go to a website, everything we needed on that page would be given to us there and then. For instance, if you go to http://wikipedia.org, the server loads the content and sends it back to us.*

*The problem with this is that data displayed on the page could only be updated when the user refreshes. This also meant no smooth transitions between pages (every page the user navigated to would be reloaded in the web browser).*

Notice now that there’s an example to illustrate the idea, and once the situation is presented, then we talk about the problem. Also now, we’ve better explained what “no smooth transition between pages” means.
